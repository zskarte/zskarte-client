Zivilschutz-Karte is a javascript application (based on Angular) which allows to draw situation maps for disaster management. It has been developed for Swiss civil defense organisations. The drawing application can be used either with standard computers or with interactive whiteboards.

## Installation

Zivilschutz-Karte is optimized and tested for use with Google Chrome - nevertheless other browsers might work as well and are supported in a best effort manner.

If you don't have a Google Chrome installation and do not have the permissions to install software, please see http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/google_chrome_portable

### Use

You can run Zivilschutz-Karte without installation from https://zskarte.ch. This is the production application. Please request access from your civil defence organisation or use the guest mode to try out.

## Terms of use

Please note, that this application integrates several different map provider services. Since the terms of use of the different services usually restrict the extent of use (limited quotas, restricted access to data layers), it's the liability of the user to make sure that the corresponding limitations and/or preconditions are fulfilled.

### Development server

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

A build is automatically created when merging into master.
